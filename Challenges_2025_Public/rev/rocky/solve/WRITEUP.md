============

Named after ROCKYou.txt, this is a nice and simple reversing challenge to get you in the mood.

Open up the binary in your flavour of tool and you'll immediately see that the input is compared with a hash. If it matches, the input is then used in some kind of AES decryption.

Extract the hash and crack it. Problem solved!
