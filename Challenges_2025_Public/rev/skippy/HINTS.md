1. Draw out a control flow diagram for the program. Which functions are called, and in what order? Are there functions which are simply there to encrypt and decrypt a payload?
2. There are only 2 functions which affect the output of program. Try to identify which one is needed, and which one is mangling the output.
3. If you think you've identified the unnecessary function, try patch the binary to skip the function! You can always get a fresh binary and patch again if you get it wrong.
