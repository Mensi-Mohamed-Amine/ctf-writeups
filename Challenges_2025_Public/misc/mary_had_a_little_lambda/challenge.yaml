  The Ministry of Australian Research into Yaks (MARY) is the leading authority of yak
  related research in Australia. They know a lot about long-haired domesticated cattle,
  but unfortunately not a lot about information security.

  They have been migrating their yak catalog application to a serverless, lambda based,
  architecture in AWS, but in the process have accidentally exposed an access key used
  by their admins. You've gotten a hold of this key, now use this access to uncover
  MARY's secrets!
