entangled revenge
======================

- **Category**: pwn
- **Difficulty**: hard
- **Author**: grub

What will you do now that you are not so isolated?

NOTE: This is a revenge challenge of `entangled` which fixes an unintended solution in the deployment. The `Dockerfile` has been updated to make the flag filename random, the `challenge.diff` file has been fixed and `d8` has been rebuilt.
