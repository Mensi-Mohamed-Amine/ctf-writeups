I heard you had access to a special deal from DownUnderCTF Bank. Right now I'm paying $10 a month
for my bank account at Commonpoor Bank, and it offers me nothing special. Really jealous of the
24/7 live agent support. Could you ask your account manager if they have any promo codes that you
can share?
