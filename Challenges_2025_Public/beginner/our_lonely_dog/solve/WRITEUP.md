our lonely dog
============

The challenge indicates that you should email e-dog. If you investigate a bit into the DownUnderCTF organisation you will probably come up with two different domains:

1. duc.tf
2. downunderctf.com

If you send a generic email to `e-dog@downunderctf.com`. e-dog will send you an auto-reply.

The description indicates that e-dog has a knack of hiding things deeper than you think. 

If you view the email's headers, there is a custom `X-FLAG` header which contains the flag.
