We were digging through the old archives and we found the following email, maybe 
you can make sense of it? It came with two attachments.
```
TO:       CuriousCultist@bigpond.com 
FROM:     XXXXDYNi103@bestEditor.net
SUBJECT:  RE: Recruitment... Final Test

Dear CC,

Congratulations on making it this far, however, as I'm sure 
you're aware, we have to be careful about usurpers and bad 
faith actors infiltrating the fold.

Attached is your final test, use your knowledge to extract 
the password and reply to this email with it. We look 
forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
    ..........
