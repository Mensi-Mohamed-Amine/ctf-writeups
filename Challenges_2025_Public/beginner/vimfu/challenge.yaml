  We were digging through the old archives and we found the following email, maybe 
  you can make sense of it? It came with two attachments.
  ```
  TO:       CuriousCultist@bigpond.com 
  FROM:     XXXXDYNi103@bestEditor.net
  SUBJECT:  RE: Recruitment... Final Test

  Dear CC,

  Congratulations on making it this far, however, as I'm sure 
  you're aware, we have to be careful about usurpers and bad 
  faith actors infiltrating the fold.

  Attached is your final test, use your knowledge to extract 
  the password and reply to this email with it. We look 
  forward to hearing from you.

  Sincerely,
      ..........
