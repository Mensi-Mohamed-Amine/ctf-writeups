# What admin panel? 

Have you looked through horoscopes yet? Maybe they mention it? 

# I found it but I dunno what port <hex number here> is? 

Maybe you can decode hex to decimal? 

# What address do I connect to? 

Given its an admin panel for this server.. perhaps the same address?...

# I connect but my client says TLS failed 

The challenge description mentions they didn't finish it, maybe its broken?

Maybe you could connect a different way? perhaps netcat or socat? 

# I use netcat but get nothing back?

What do you know about Gemini? 
 - Is it just files ?
 - How do you route to files?
 - What do we consider root on all other systems?
 - '/' is your friend.

# I get back a weird error message 

GREAT! Google it! You're so close! Maybe there is a way you can parse gemini over command line? 

# What is 11 INPUT ?

Gemini protocol status code?! What could it mean?! How can you abuse it ?!

# I get to the admin login but what password?????? 

Check horoscopes! Its in plain sight! They even tell you!
