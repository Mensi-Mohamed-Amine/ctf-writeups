# About the Wasteland Network

## Our Origins

When the internet began to crumble, a small group of digital preservationists had already been experimenting with alternative protocols. We saw the warning signs years before the Cascade Virus spread:

1. Increasing browser complexity
2. Security through obscurity
3. Centralization of web resources
4. Over-reliance on JavaScript execution
5. The advertising-surveillance complex

We built this network on the principles of digital minimalism, embracing the Gemini protocol not as a nostalgic throwback, but as the sustainable future of human information exchange.

## Why Gemini Survived

The Gemini protocol was designed with intentional limitations that proved to be its salvation:

* No client-side scripting
* No cookies or tracking mechanisms
* Simple TLS security model
* Content negotiation limited to MIME types
* Strict separation of content and presentation

When the polymorphic HTTPS exploits emerged, they targeted the complex attack surfaces of modern browsers. Our simple Gemini clients had nothing for these viruses to latch onto - no JavaScript engines to hijack, no plugin architectures to exploit.

## Our Mission

The Wasteland Network exists to:

1. Maintain secure communication between survivor communities
2. Preserve essential knowledge from before The Collapse
3. Document our current reality for future generations
4. Develop protocols for safely exploring digital ruins
5. Rebuild a simpler, more resilient internet
