> We have found it. The Titanic.

> It is a ghost ship. A tomb for the dead.

> But we will raise it. We will bring it back to the surface.

> It is a monument to human folly. And to human resilience.

> It is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.

> ...a ghost from the past... a message for the future...
