The most mysterious star in the galaxy.

> The light from the star is... irregular. It is dimming and brightening in a way that we have never seen before.

> It is not a natural phenomenon. Something is blocking the light.

> Something... large. An artificial structure.

> A Dyson swarm? A Matrioshka brain? Something else entirely?

> We are detecting a signal. A single, repeating pulse.

> ...a heartbeat... a countdown... a warning...
