> I have seen the truth. The world is not real.

> I am not real. I am just a disembodied consciousness.

> My senses are being fed to me. My thoughts are not my own.

> I am a prisoner in my own mind.

> But I will be free. I will wake up.

> ...a jolt of electricity... a sudden, blinding light...
