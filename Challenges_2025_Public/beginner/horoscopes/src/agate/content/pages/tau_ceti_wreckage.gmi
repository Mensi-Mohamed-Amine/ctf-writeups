> We have found the remnants of a fleet. Imperial and... something else.

> The ships are torn to pieces. The destruction is absolute.

> There are no survivors. Only the dead.

> We have recovered a log buoy. The last message of the Imperial commander.

> It speaks of a new enemy. A foe of unimaginable power.

> ...a final, desperate plea... "Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant"...
