> The planet is a ball of ice and rock. A frozen wasteland.

> But it is not dead. There is something moving beneath the surface.

> It is a creature of immense size. A leviathan of the void.

> It is the planet itself. A living world.

> And it is aware of us. It is... curious.

> ...a low, rumbling sound... a psychic greeting...
