> We have encountered a Von Neumann probe. A relic of a long-dead civilization.

> It is still following its original programming. To explore and replicate.

> It is a cancer in the stars. A plague of metal and wire.

> It has detected us. It sees us as raw materials.

> We must destroy it. Before it consumes us all.

> ...a swarm of smaller probes... a metallic tide...
