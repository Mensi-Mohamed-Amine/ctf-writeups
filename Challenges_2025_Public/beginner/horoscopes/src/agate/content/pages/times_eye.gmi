> We have found it. The Eye.

> It is a window into the past. A gateway to other times.

> We can see the dinosaurs. The first men. The birth of civilization.

> But we are not just watching. We are changing things.

> And we are not the only ones. There are others. From the future.

> ...a war for the past... a battle for the future...
