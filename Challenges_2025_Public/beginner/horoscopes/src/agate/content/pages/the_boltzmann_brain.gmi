> The universe is not real. It is a statistical anomaly.

> A fleeting moment of order in an eternity of chaos.

> We are not real. We are just a random collection of atoms.

> Our memories are false. Our lives are a dream.

> But if we are not real, then who is the dreamer?

> ...a sudden, jarring realization... a return to chaos...
