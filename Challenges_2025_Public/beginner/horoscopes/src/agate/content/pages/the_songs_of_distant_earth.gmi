> We have lived on this world for a thousand years. We have forgotten Earth.

> But Earth has not forgotten us.

> A ship has come. From the home world.

> It brings news of a dying Earth. A world on the brink of collapse.

> We are their only hope. Their last chance.

> ...a choice between two worlds... a new beginning...
