## I don't know where to start?

Have you connected to the port? What bytes does it send back? What could you infer from that?

Have you tried googling those bytes? Have you tried using TCPDUMP to inspect them? The -XX flag? :eyes: 

Read the challenge description again, maybe it has hints!

## I connected but I don't know what to do next?

Have you identified what it is? Perhaps there are other ways to access that protocol? 

Perhaps there are clients for this particular protocol? 

Have you tried using a GUI program to connect to it? 

What protocol is it? (if they dunno, send em back to the start) ( if they do, suggest searching for Gemini GUI clients)

## I know its gemini, but I can't figure it out over netcat

Perhaps there are GUI methods :eyes:

What about Lagrange?!

## I have access! Now what?

Where is the flag? Start looking! (its in plain text ez to find)

ITS LITERALLY ON THE HOME PAGE
