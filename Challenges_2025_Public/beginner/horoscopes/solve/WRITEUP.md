Horoscopes! Thats a clue! And little Timmy is a Taurus, a month before his mum and dad 
which would make them both.. Gemini's!
This is a hint for what we should be using to connect to this challenge. Some kind of Gemini browser.

If you don't like wordplay, looking at the bytes will give you better information such as "59 Invalid URL" which with a little 
googling should lead you down the path to the Gemini internet protocol.

I wrote my own called [Cricket](https://github.com/Pix-xiP/Cricket) but there is a fantastic free one named Legrange that you can use 
to visualize it like a browser!

Access the port with your browser of choice, now you're on a new web, if we navigate to the salvaging.gmi page, right at the bottom you'll find a DUCTF flag!
