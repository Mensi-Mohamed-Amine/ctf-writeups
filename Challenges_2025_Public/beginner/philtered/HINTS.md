# Hints

**If they haven't gotten started yet, or don't know where to go:**

- How is the server loading these resources?

**If they are talking have only found the variables that they need to provide, i.e. allow_unsafe=1, config[path]=flag.php, config[data_folder]=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=** (the order for the config[data_folder] and [path] don't matter so much but they have to have at least some value)

- The page is something very weird after initializing the object. Are you sure that you're providing the right values?

**If they have only gotten halfway:**

- Try to see if you can add some debug statements to understand the application behaviour a bit better.
