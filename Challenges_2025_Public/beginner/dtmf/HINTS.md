# Hints

## :D

### No idea where to start?

Have a look at the title.. maybe its more then it lets on?

They can't remember how this tech works, maybe modulate frequencies isn't right?

### Figured out its DTMF tones but they're wrong?

How do you make a DTMF tone?

Low and High Frequencies.. what about combined frequencies?

### Have got DTMF tones and converted to numbers and '#'

The flag is alphanumeric, how could you convert numbers to letters?

How did they text people before smart phones?

### Completely lost?

How do old phones send SMS messages? <- should be more then enough to google and figure this out.


### BEEP BOOP BOOP BEEP 

What do you call the sounds that a phone makes when you press a number?
