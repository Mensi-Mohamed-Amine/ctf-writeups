In this challenge, CI/CD pipelines and Terraform are being used to manage AWS resources.
Part of this infrastructure utilises an S3 bucket, which is used to stage files and
configuration. Being security conscious individuals, the admins have prevented misuse of
this bucket by configuring access only to Terraform. They are also using S3 presigned
URLs to provide timeboxed access to certain files without sharing credentials.

Given a presigned URL for `flag.txt` (generated by the CI/CD pipeline user), and the
resource policy applied to the S3 bucket, find a way to get at the flag!
