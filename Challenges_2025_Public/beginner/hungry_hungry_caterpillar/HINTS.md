# Hints

1. What is the XOR operation and how does it work? If you know A XOR B = C and
   the values of any two of A, B, or C, you can figure out the third one.
   
2. Try to map out which values are XOR'd together. If you know one character of
   the flag, you can propogate that knowledge to deduce the other characters of
   the flag.
   
3. If you're trying to script the solve, https://oeis.org/A002473 may come in
   handy.
