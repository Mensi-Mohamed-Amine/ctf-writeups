From the original challenge text: We've been albe to pull some audio from a tape backup, only problem is it's from 1995!! We know it's a Sydney number and there must be a modem at the other end...who are they calling?

I understand that many players would have not heard what a dial up modem sounds like, let alone use one, though let's time travel back to 1995 (challenge text) to find out who they're calling. It's not the number we're after, but what they're calling.

We know that it's a modem, so there's a modem on the other end, hence the handshake sound. This would be another computer or a Bulletin Board System (BBS). At this stage I hope you've got the number, so it's time to search.

Googling the number "369 3244" (the numbers corresponding to the tones) and "BBS" will give you a result (http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/nightowl-016/002A/GBBS9504/GBBS9504.TXT) that shows a stack of old BBS numbers. Inside here, you'll find Hotline BBS, with the full phone number being 61 2 369 3244.

Something intresting, when searching for phone numbers, you quite often need to mix it up to get better results, e.g. "1234 5678" "12345678" "1234-5678" "123 45 678" etc. A good OSINT tip for everyone :)
