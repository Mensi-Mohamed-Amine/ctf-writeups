We've been given a black and white photo of a bridge. Google reverse image search only brings up 2 results which both mention Epping Bridge Project published by Transport for NSW. This gives us suburb.

The publication gives us history about Epping Bridge, but nothing else. The quick way to find the name of the old cinema is to simply search "old cinema epping nsw", and within the first handful of searches, a cinema treasures website or the Parramatta History and Heritage website pops up with results for Cambria Hall.

Opening either of these links will give you the address of 46 Beecroft Road (since we already know the suburb and now the name of the cinema). The number is actually slightly off - a quick google maps search reveals it's actually 47 as 46 is the building clearly labelled next door. This is also confirmed by Sydney Science College's website that specifies "Set within the revitalized foundation of Epping's historic 1930s cinema", with 47 listed in their address. Hornsby shire recollects website also has a comparison of The Cambria Hall from then and now with 47 listed.
