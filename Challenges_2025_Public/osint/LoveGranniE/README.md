Hello dear, it's your Grannie E.

My lovely nurse took me out today and I found where I used to go see movies! Back in my day movies didn't talk or have sound! How the times have changed. I've added in a photo from back when I used to live there, with help from my nurse. 

I'm going for a cuppa now, will call later.

Love,\
Grannie E.

Given the image from Grannie E, can you find the name of the movie building, and its current day location? I'll need a suburb too.

NOTE: Sometimes old records get out of date, you might need to try the street number next door

Flag Format: `DUCTF{BuildingName_StreetAddress_Suburb}` (case insensitive) - include the street number in the address
