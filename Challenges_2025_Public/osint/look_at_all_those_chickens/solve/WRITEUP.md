Look at all those chickens
============

Reverse image search and including the keywords "bin chicken" brings up several results for a bin chicken island in Coburg, Melbourne. 

The challenge wants the name of the site the bin chickens were held captive, which is apparently nearby so opening up google maps and searching in the area, and across the road is Pentridge Prison.
