Look At All Those Chickens!
============

Include 3 hints for beginner/easy challenges:

Hint 1: I wonder what types of chickens those are?

Hint 2: Perhaps a reverse image search with some keywords will bring up some clues?

Hint 3: The challenge wants a location of where the bin chickens were kept hostage. If they've escaped to this little island, perhaps there's somewhere close nearby?
