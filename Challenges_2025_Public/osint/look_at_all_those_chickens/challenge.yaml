  Hmmm, it appears this image was sent last year when one of our brave hackers
  went out to follow a lead to save some birds from those nasty bugs, but 
  couldn't reach them! We did have it on good word that they were in
  captivity nearby to the picture that was taken- can you find out the name of
  the place where these birds were locked up?

  **NOTE: We know where the birds are right now, stop telling us! We want to know where they were captive, not where they're vibing!**

  The flag format is `DUCTF{Captivity_Name}` (case insensitive)

  The answer is two words
