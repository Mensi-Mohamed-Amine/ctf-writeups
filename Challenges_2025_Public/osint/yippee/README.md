We were going through a stack of pictures and postcards that we found in the hope that we can put together a timeline of events. This one looks interesting, on the back of the photo there a hand drawn picture of what looks to be a waratah flower, but that's it.

Can you locate where this is?

Wrap the location name in `DUCTF{}` (case insensitive, no spaces)
